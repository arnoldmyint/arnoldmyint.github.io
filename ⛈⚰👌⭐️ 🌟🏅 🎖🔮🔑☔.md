b)PROJECT OVERVIEW

This application was developed as part of BCIT's COMP 2910 Project Term in the span of 4 weeks with a team of 5 individuals. It was written in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a bit of php.

Game Title: Brain Roll

Short Description: The game consist of a grid that randomly generates a starting point and ending point. The goal is to create a path for the brain from the starting point to the ending point without destroying the brain. (i.e, you cannot make the brain drop for more than a level, if you want to move one level down, you should use a slope).

d)Technologies used

Most of game was coded in JS without 3rd party library.
Device.js is used to detect different devices.
Google Spreadsheet (with php) to submit and retrieve highscore.


e)Issues/problems encountered
	1) We made most of the game on our own which took a lot of time. We should have used some 3rd party libraries.
	2) Really hard to make the game playable on both desktop and laptop across all OS using different browsers. 


USER GUIDE

To test our game,
open index.html
select Play
select Challenge.

Currently, the first game level will be available to play with limited blocks. The first one, cube and second one, SW Slope works. 

Note: Upon testing the game, loss or win, you will be redirected to our live website
so you will no longer be on the local version. You may continue playing from here but it will be on the version we are actively updating
so there may be issues.
To play again with the version we submitted, open the local index.html again.
