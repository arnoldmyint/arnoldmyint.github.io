	<h2>Chinese Zodiac Signs and Their Meanings</h2>

		<p>
					&emsp; The Chinese Zodiac is much like western astrology star signs. There are 12 animals to represent the 12 months in a year, 
					each corresponding to a believed personality along with how well each person should or should not get along with each other type of zodiac sign.
					While some people believe that this is just all cultural superstition, there are quite a few people who believe the zodiac dictates how their
					entire life will turn out. I'm sure you are familiar with horoscopes, &#40;forecasts and predictions of peoples futures usually based upon their star or zodiac sign&#41;
					There are people who base their actions on what is predicted for them inside of these horoscopes.
					<br /> &emsp; There are many stories and fables to explain the beginning of the zodiac. Since the Han Dynasty, the 12 Earthly Branches have been used to record the time of day.
					However, for the sake of entertainment and convenience, they have been replaced by the 12 animals. The stories have been passed down throguh many generations,
					so there has been deviation between different cultures interpretations through many of the regions of southeast Asia.
